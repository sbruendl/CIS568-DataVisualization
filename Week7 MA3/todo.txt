Cluster by country

Publishers are nodes

co-author are links 
(linked if the same author)

citations are size of node

citations are radius factor

				Using NetworkX and the Author Network Data provided in this link, 
				prepare the visualization JSON file:(20/100 points) 
				Nodes: Publications (papers or books)
				Links:  At least one co-author (refer to the colab notebook). 
				This means two articles are linked they share at least one author.

Cluster (Apply Class) the data by first author's country -- use (10/100 points)

Apply a class of First authors country of affiliation (see colab)
'Authors with affiliations' (In the videos I have taken the publications as nodes.) (10/100 points)


				Use force simulation to create a force layout visualization (20/100 points)
				The number of citations for each publication is considered as the size of the node 
				(choose a suitable min-max for the domain, and apply scaleSqrt)

				Apply 'charge' with d3.forceManyBody() and 'collision', d3.forceCollide() (10/100 points)
				d3.forceCollide() radius factor can be the number of citations (optional) -- 
				Note a circle with a radius of 0 will not show up, so choose range wisely.

Make a web page on GitHub for the visualization (20/100 points) For steps see here https://pages.github.com/

Apply Styling, color coding, and mouse interaction, zoom, drag... (+10/100 points) bonus points


------- Notes
When exporting the json, data may create extra nodes with only id=EID. These must be deleted 

The get_first_author_affiliation is prone to failure. in the case of EID=2-s2.0-0242424259, authors
are delimited by ; instead of , resulting in the method to identify the country as Riley K.'s last name
so the country appears to be "K." I manually cleaned this

EID=2-s2.0-0035193888 has no country.
same as:
2-s2.0-27544450057
2-s2.0-27544454309
2-s2.0-27544437912
2-s2.0-0035193821
2-s2.0-0035193714

some institutions were interpreted as countries (I changed them to United States)
2-s2.0-0031356236 (Univ Lowell)
2-s2.0-33749594714 (google)
2-s2.0-0031372649 (visible decisions inc)
